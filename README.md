# Urbit String

String processing library for Urbit.

Extremely stale. Likely still usable, but definitely dated. Any future work in this area will go into [suite/lib](https://github.com/fang-/suite/tree/master/lib).

### Installing / Using

1. clone this repo
1. cp -r ./* pier/desk/
1. From the dojo:
  * |start %string-tester
  * :string-tester %test

You will then see a series of tests and then a final status...

```
>=
%sum
%tail
... more %test_names ...
[%all-passed "(:"]
```
